Tokyo
is
Burning
Japan
saves
energy
by
keeping
office
buildings
at
82
degrees
Is
this
foresighted
or
perverse
By

I
should
have
suspected
something
was
amiss
when
we—the
group
of
journalists
I'm
traveling
with
in
Japan
for
10
days
showed
up
at
the
offices
of
the
media
company
Nikkei,
and
our
Japanese
counterparts,
columnists,
and
editors
apologized
for
not
wearing
ties.
We
had
received
instructions
that
meetings
were
business
formal,
jacket
and
tie.
But
after
a
few
minutes,
we
understood
why
our
Japanese
colleagues
had
gone
business
casual.
The
air
conditioner
in
their
brand-new
Tokyo
office
tower
seemed
to
be
on
the
fritz.
It
was
as
hot
and
muggy
as
Miami.

Shuttling
about
the
city,
I
thought
I
had
discovered
an
epidemic
of
air-conditioning
malfunction.
The
same
experience
of
tieless
Japanese
officials
welcoming
sweating
Americans
was
repeated
at
the
Foreign
Ministry,
the
Bank
of
Japan,
and
the
headquarters
of
the
Democratic
Party
of
Japan.
A
conference
room
at
the
Japan
Iron
and
Steel
Federation
was
like
a
sweatbox.
This
was
a
true
mystery,
since
Japan
is
famous
for
1)
business
formality
and
2)
developing
cooling
technology.
Every
morning,
I
marvel
at
the
wall-length
bathroom
mirrors
in
my
hotel
on
which
a
perfect
rectangle
above
the
sink
remains
miraculously
steam-free.

But
I
soon
solved
the
mystery
of
the
failing
air
conditioner.
Japan
has
eagerly
embraced
technology
and
practices
that
will
reduce
emissions
and
combat
global
warming.
It
invented
hybrid
vehicles,
has
extensive
mass-transit
systems,
and
uses
wind
power.
In
2005,
Environment
Minister
Yuriko
Koike,
a
pioneering
female
politician,
was
seeking
ways
to
slash
energy
use.
And
she
came
up
with
the
Cool
Biz
campaign.
The
idea:
Government
would
cut
energy
bills
by
keeping
thermostats
in
its
buildings
at
28
degrees
Celsius—82.4
degrees
Fahrenheit—during
the
summer.
It
quickly
produced
results
and
was
adopted
by
the
business
establishment
as
well.
Since
Japan's
energy
mavens
realized
that
simply
unbuttoning
a
shirt
collar
can
make
people
feel
about
4
degrees
cooler,
dressing
down
became
part
of
the
Cool
Biz
mentality.
(Here's
an
ABC
News
story
on
the
phenomenon.)
The
only
people
we
met
with
this
week
wearing
suits,
ties,
and
cufflinks
were
Americans—diplomats
at
the
embassy
and
the
boosters
from
the
American
Chamber
of
Commerce
in
Japan.

The
progenitor
of
Cool
Biz
practices
what
she
preaches.
Koike
is
sort
of
the
Hillary
Clinton
of
Japan.
A
former
television
anchor
and
reporter,
she
served
as
the
nation's
first
female
defense
minister
and
then
mounted
an
unsuccessful
challenge
for
her
party's
leadership.
She's
still
trying
to
break
Japan's
iron
ceiling.
We
visited
Koike
in
her
(boiling)
district
office,
discussing
politics
while
a
highlight
reel
of
her
broadcasting
career
played
on
a
television.
"It's
important
that
we
create
a
low-carbon
society,"
she
said.
"It
will
make
our
economy
more
wealthy."
As
we
exited
the
building,
finding
relief
in
the
heavy
evening
air,
Koike
was
whisked
away
in
a
Prius.

Don't
get
me
wrong.
Turning
up
the
thermostat
in
the
summer
and
turning
it
down
in
the
winter
is
a
fine
way
to
reduce
energy
use
and
fight
global
warning.
But
if
we're
going
to
go
down
this
road
as
a
global
business
community,
we
might
consider
allowing
professionals
to
show
up
to
work
in
shorts
and
T-shirts.

And
it
struck
me
that
Cool
Biz
might
be
counterproductive
for
Japan.
Japan
is
currently
facing
something
of
an
existential
crisis.
Its
economy
has
grown
very
slowly
for
more
than
a
decade,
and
its
population
is
declining.
It's
as
if
the
nation
has
lost
its
capacity
for
hard
work
and
procreation.

Kiyoaki
Fujiwara,
director
of
the
economic
policy
bureau
of
the
Japan
Business
Federation,
laid
out
some
stark
charts
showing
a
rapid
population
decline
over
the
next
50
years
and
the
dire
economic
impact
it
would
have.
But
maybe
there's
some
connection
between
Japan's
demographic/economic
issues
and
the
Cool
Biz
program.
For
a
good
chunk
of
the
year,
the
heat
indoors
saps
the
desire
to
write
a
business
plan
or
to
increase
the
population.
As
the
noted
Japan
expert
Cole
Porter
memorably
put
it:
"It's
Too
Darn
Hot."
